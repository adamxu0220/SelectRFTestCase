<div>
    The <strong>filesystem-list-parameter-plugin</strong> lists file system object names of a directory. 
    One of the object names can be selected as build parameter. In addition the objects can be filtered: 
    <code>ALL, DIRECTORY, FILE, SYMLINK</code>. The order of the list can be reversed.
